## ðŸ“Œ Day 1 - Project 1: band-name-generator
On day 1 of programming I coded band-name-generator. You write the name of your birthplace, then the name of your first pet. And it combines them to make a band name. Look at this code and write your own band-name-generator. Click [here](https://github.com/saidjami/100daysofcode/tree/main/Day-1%20band-name-generator) to access the code. Good coding.
